Abstract:
  This document defines the Access Control Policies Language (ACP), a language for
  enforcing resource access against a set of conditions. These conditions are provided
  as Access Controls, Policies, and Matchers, expressed in the form of an RDF graph.
  RDF graphs that are used in this manner are called "authorization graphs" in ACP,
  and the resource accesses that are validated against an authorization graph are
  called "context graphs". As ACP authorization graphs are used to validate whether
  context graphs satisfy a set of conditions, they can also be viewed as a description
  of the context graphs that do satisfy these conditions.
